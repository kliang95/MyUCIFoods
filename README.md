# MyUCIFoods
In-progress Android app that connects UCI students to find other students to eat with

Users will be able to select restaurants nearby UCI based on a variety of categories (time, cuisine, and type of food) and the application will utilize Yelp to find the best suited restaruant based on the criteria. The price, calories, and nutritional data will also be provided. Users will also be able to interact and chat with other students using the application. A map is also provided so the user can travel by foot or by shuttle to get to their desired location. 

This app was created in collaboration with Robert Luo and Jessica Vu for Next Generation Search Systems.
